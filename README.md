In this project, I built an SMS Spam Detection system using Logistic Regression. I preprocessed the dataset by converting SMS messages into feature vectors using TfidfVectorizer and labeled spam and ham messages for binary classification. I split the data into training and testing sets and trained the model, achieving high accuracy on both datasets. The model was evaluated using the accuracy_score metric. I saved the trained model using joblib for future predictions and implemented a simple interface to classify new SMS messages as spam or ham. This project demonstrates my ability to preprocess text data, apply machine learning models, and deploy them for real-world use cases.
